Reproducible research with R
============================



This repository contains the files which were used for a series of seminars
concerning reproducible research with R which took place at the University of
Turku in our research group ([PnP group][pnpwebsite]). More details about
the seminars can be found [here][mdjbruwebsite].

The topics addressed during the 3 seminars were:

  * version control with `Git`
  * report generation with `knitr` and `Sweave`
  * figure building with `make`
