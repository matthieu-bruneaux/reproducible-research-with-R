Reproducible research with R
============================



This repository contains the files which were used for a series of
seminars/practicals concerning reproducible research with R. Those sessions
took place at the University of Turku in our research group ([PnP
group][pnpwebsite]). More details about the seminars can be found
[here][mdjbruwebsite]. Each seminar starts with a short presentation and then
focuses on hands-on experience.

The topics addressed during the 3 sessions were:

  1. version control with `Git`
  2. report generation with `knitr` and `Sweave`
  3. figure building with `make`



# Repository structure

  * `presentations` contains the Powerpoint files and the corresponding pdf
    files used during each session.

  * `practical.courses.files` contains the data files and the R scripts used
    during each session.

  * `zip.files` contains one zip file per session. Each zip file contains all
    the material for a given session, including the presentation and the data and
    R scripts.
  


# How to use this repository

You can use the GitHub repository if you want to clone the whole repository and
have access to all the files. However, if you just want to download some files
(e.g. the zip files), you should go to [this page][mdjbruwebsite] since GitHub
does not allow, to my knowledge, to download single files from a repository.
